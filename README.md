Python 3 Scripts for format conversion - Bioinformatics 

I have been creating a series of scripts in Python that serve different purposes but mainly focus on reformatting files e.g. converting from methylkit compatible format to RnBeads compatible format, etc.

Please, bear in mind that these scripts are not perfect and if you have any suggestions on how to improve them, I will be more than happy to hear them!

Thanks :)
