METHYLKIT 2 RNBEADS

This script takes a Methylkit compatible output, format as follows:

chrBase   chr   base    strand    coverage    freqC   freqT
x.xxxx    x      xxxx     R/F       1-n       100.00    0.00

And outputs a bedGraph style format (header not included! read notes below):0

chr   start   end    coverage   freqC   freqT
 x    xxxx    xxxx     1-n     100.00    0.00

A few things to bear in mind:

1) Methylkit output does not have base start / base end columns. This would correspond to a start position - I have been working with RStudio so I add the column as needed there, 
but I intend to update this script so that it performs the addition of this column.

2) bedGraph format does not require a header. I have uploaded a bash script that I use to remove the header on my files, but I also will update this script
so that everything is done in one go.

3) Frequencies of C and T are technically meant to be whole numbers - I have not parsed this yet as I do it in RStudio, but I will be updating this script
to change this
